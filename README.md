### Project Description
SnarkGPT is your new brutally honest, sarcastic chatbot that answers your questions with equal parts sass and disdain.  
No AI models. No cloud. Just pure handcrafted sarcasm, delivered at lightning speed in your browser.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tired of boring, polite chatbots?  
Do you *wish* your computer would roast you instead of helping you?  
We thought so.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a chatbot that doesn't care about your feelings.  
It doesn't just answer ‚Äî it answers *with attitude*.  
If you leave this chat without questioning your life choices, we failed.
